# ESP32 random number guesser webserver response
 ESP32 mini server experimentation
The scope of this project is to build a mini client server that will send a GET request for a value and return a response of true/false
eventually I want to get this mini project connected to a larger experimental project I have where you can send a request to the microcontroller via a larger web project.

Milestone 1: Successfully generate HTML code and responses that are handled in the micro controller using C++. :white_check_mark:

Milestone 2: add header value extraction and conversion for greater handling capabilities within the microcontroller. 


Goal: connect random number guesser to a larger project so a user can select and play guess while the microcontroller is operational

##Note:The sample code will evolve with time
