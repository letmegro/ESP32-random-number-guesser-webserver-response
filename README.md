# ESP32 random number guesser webserver response
 ESP32 mini server experimentation
The scope of this project is to build a mini client server that will send a GET request for a value and return a response of true/false
eventually I want to get this mini project connected to a larger experimental project I have where you can send a request to the microcontroller via a larger web project.

Mini Project 1:

    Milestone 1: Successfully generate HTML code and responses that are handled in the micro controller using C++. :white_check_mark:

    Milestone 2: add header value extraction and conversion for greater handling capabilities within the microcontroller. :white_check_mark:

Mini Project 2:

    Milestone 1: Add a method for transmitting basic JSON formatted data

    Milestone 2: incorporate previous mini project microcontroller to make a request for a random value from a different microcontroller that will act as an API which will handle the request and return a randomly generated value

Goal: connect random number guesser to a larger project so a user can select and play guess while the microcontroller is operational

##Note:The sample code will evolve with time
